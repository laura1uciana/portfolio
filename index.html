      <p>When did Charles become a fag? When did Laura become a hag? Together, Vanity Project explore a sexless, but very sexy dialectic: this time, in the form of an introductory reading for the “Fag/Hag” launch. The new book by Max Fox and Madeline Laine-MicKinley was published by Rosa Press and launched on Monday the 26th of August in Sydney. 
          “I’ve always had a fascination for gay boys, lesbians, and transgender people,” Laura confesses as she asks the question, is it more desperate for a hag to need her fag? Or the other way round? After Freedom! ‘90 comes the animated aughts. Modern Family, Glee, Prince Charming. Vanity Project were born this way, baby! And they wave the Fag/Hag Flag with pride!</p>

      <p><i>Rearranging, recollecting and recovering: these are the actions that define Claudia Nicholson as she reaches back into her archive. ‘If The Mountain Is Burning, Let It Burn' is a sombre, blurry and glittering exhibition, and the latest output of the University of Technology Sydney’s (UTS) Artist in Residence program. Positioned within the Ultimo campus, UTS Gallery is dimly lit, as if you were searching for photographic clarity through a smouldering haze.</i></p>

      <p>Designed and written by Laura Luciana. Curated by Laura Luciana and Charles Carrall. As Vanity Project we held a reading event with Flower Books to create a sexy and scholarly discourse about condoms, jerking off, latex and gloves as fetishwear, and doing it RAW.</p>

      <p><i>Seeing the doomscroll (usually contained in the phone) materialise in the gallery really looks like “too much information”—too much information being compulsively excavated by online users posting, too much information that we ingest by being “chronically online."</i></p>

      <p><i>We joke about conjuring the ghosts of Vanity Project’s imprisoned forefathers, Oscar Wilde and the Marquis de Sade, locked up for their indecent perversions. We’re just like them! In another time we would be punished for speaking so freely, and joyfully, about sex and sexuality. Thankfully, our unrelenting propulsion to obscenity has opened doors rather than sealed them shut.</i></p>

      <p><i>Taking Western Sydney as its starting point, Jus Diddit asks: what does it take to create vibrant communities and resonant subcultures, and where do you start? For the local ravers, punks, and queers celebrated and archived in Jus Diddit, the answer is simple: they just did it. Curators Levent Can Kaya and Carmen Mercedes Gago Schieb speak in the language of the scenes because they inhabit these scenes.</i></p>
