        <p>On Monday 12th May we committed to an Endurance Study #1: a reading of Lauren Berlant’s iconic Cruel Optimism. We are honoured to read under Sydney Jarrett’s An Order Into Another, who is always thinking about the ways that being in public corrals us, our behaviours and desires, in sometimes cruel, sometimes optimistic ways.

            In the spirit of cruel optimism we endure labour, friendship, love, eating, mourning, citizenship. We attach to each other and to feelings in sustaining and subordinating ways. You, our audience, shared this burden by listening and reading with us.
            <br>            <br>
            Thank you to the scholars who inspire us, particularly to the spirit of study by Snack Syndicate, who in no small part introduced us to Berlant’s work, and support our commitment to studying together. Thank you to Schmick, in particular to Ashton and Clare who endured to the end. Thank you especially to Clare for your undying support and commitment to the project.
            <br>            <br>            
            Documentation by the brilliant Lachie Thompson.
            <br>            
            An extra thank you for the unanticipated offerings:            <br>
            To David Lobb for two hand rolled cigarettes            <br>
            To Nic for bubble tea and skewers            <br>
            To Clare for the beers            <br>
            To Astrid for the toilet paper            <br>
            To Lachie for your work documenting the performance            <br>
            To Lukas for the semolina syrup dessert            <br>
            To Ray for the cans of V            <br>
            To Josh, for your perfect timing,            <br>
            And to everyone who read, studied, and endured with us.</p>

        <p><i>Garden Variety Dykes isn’t about making encoded dyke sexualities visible, but instead reviving the political- and action-focussed era of 90s lesbian organising and making. Just like the 1994 text, Haggarty has assembled an ambitious array of ways to live in our gardens with our sexualities, cultivating their relationship to the earth in a time when this is imperilled by precarious rental contracts and the climate crisis. Gardening is sweaty, sexy work, the earth is erotic, maybe because of the ways that we touch it, maybe because its bounty is so seductive.</i></p>

        <p>Curated by Sydney Jarrett, and held at the Art Gallery of New South Wales. The <i>Critical Playlisting</i> performance lecture is an instructional seminar that encourages a community and site specific mode of listening to and comsuming music. By harnessing a nostalgia for the compilation CD, rejecting streaming, and buying music, we can understand our relationship to the creation and ownership of listening and music. It is imperative to divest from the streaming model in favour of other new or nostalgic models of music listening.</p>

    <p>When did Charles become a fag? When did Laura become a hag? Together, Vanity Project explore a sexless, but very sexy dialectic: this time, in the form of an introductory reading for the “Fag/Hag” launch. The new book by Max Fox and Madeline Laine-MicKinley was published by Rosa Press and launched on Monday the 26th of August in Sydney. 
        “I’ve always had a fascination for gay boys, lesbians, and transgender people,” Laura confesses as she asks the question, is it more desperate for a hag to need her fag? Or the other way round? After Freedom! ‘90 comes the animated aughts. Modern Family, Glee, Prince Charming. Vanity Project were born this way, baby! And they wave the Fag/Hag Flag with pride!</p>
